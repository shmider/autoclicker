# Auto Clicker

Auto Clicker is a small tool for windows to simulate mouse click. This tool also support sending text and key pressing combination. 

The next to do for the tool is to support real keyboard key combinations.

I desided to upload the source code to here for others to have the option to take it to the next level, as i do not have time to continue the developmant of the tool!
